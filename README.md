# üêç Python Code Collection

Welcome to my Python code repository. This collection features a variety of Python scripts, showcasing the core functionalities of Python through well-documented code. The repository is divided into three main sections: **Common Problems**, **Projects**, and **Practice Code**.

I wrote these codes while I was learning Python, and I'm sharing them here to help and support other learners on their journey.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Common Problems**:\
    This section contains solutions to typical algorithms and data structure problems. The files here cover topics such as:
      - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
      - **Merge Sort**
      - **Other essential algorithms**

- **Projects**: \
    Here, you'll find small projects that I built to apply my Python knowledge in real-world scenarios. Each project is documented with explanations of the code and the problem it solves.

- **Practice Code**: \
    This section includes various practice scripts that I wrote to strengthen my understanding of Python. These range from simple exercises to more complex problem-solving tasks.

## üìù Documentation

Each Python file in this repository is thoroughly documented with comments explaining the logic, flow, and purpose of the code. This should make it easier for beginners to follow along and understand how Python is applied to solve different problems.

## ü§ù Contribution

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially if you have additional practice problems, projects, or alternative solutions to common problems.
